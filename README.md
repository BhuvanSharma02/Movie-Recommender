# Movie-Recommender
This program, developed using UiPath, is designed to scrape data from a movie listing website, store the data in a CSV file, and represent it using Python (Pandas). Additionally, users can select a movie from a drop-down list, and the chosen movie will automatically play via a third-party website.
